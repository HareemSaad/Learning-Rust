    // In Rust, attempting to assign a value outside the valid range of a u8 (0-255) leads to integer overflow. In debug mode, this causes a program to panic and exit. In release mode, Rust employs twoâ€™s complement wrapping, where values beyond the maximum loop back to the minimum (e.g., 256 becomes 0). This behavior might not match your expectations and is generally considered incorrect. To manage overflow, Rust offers methods like wrapping_* for wrapping, checked_* for returning None on overflow, overflowing_* for indicating overflow with a boolean, and saturating_* for capping values at the typeâ€™s limits.
